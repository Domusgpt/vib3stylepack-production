Monolith Inc., a titan known for its sprawling 'ecosystems,' has just unveiled 'EverSuite,' marketed as the ultimate integrated solution for creative professionals. But does it align with the principles of Exoditical Moral Architecture, or is it merely another beautifully crafted cage? This report investigates."

We'll examine the practical realities of data ownership within this 'all-in-one' environment. The key question: is your data truly yours if extracting it requires a Herculean effort?"

The exodus continues, and vigilance is our primary tool."
