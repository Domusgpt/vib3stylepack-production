      "content": "One of the core tenets of Exoditical Moral Architecture (EMA) is that 'Portability is a Feature, Not a Footnote.' For open source projects, this isn't just a nice-to-have; it's a declaration of respect for user autonomy. This article dives into practical strategies for designing data export functionalities that truly liberate your users and their data."
